If you're having trouble committing changes in GitHub Codespaces, follow these steps to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

1. Check Git Status
Open the terminal in your Codespace and run:

>git status

This will show if there are uncommitted changes and which branch you are on.

2. Ensure You're on the Right Branch
Make sure you're working on the correct branch:

>git branch

If you're not on the expected branch, switch to it:

>git checkout <branch-name>

3. Stage Your Changes
Use the following command to add all modified files:

>git add .

4. Commit the Changes
Run:

>git commit -m "Your commit message"

If you see an error, check if your Git identity is set up:

>git config --global user.name "Your Name"
>git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"

5. Push the Changes
Send your changes to GitHub:

>git push origin <branch-name>

If you see an authentication error, try:

>git push --force

6. Check Remote Repository
Ensure your Codespace is linked to the correct GitHub repository:

>git remote -v

If needed, set the correct remote:

>git remote set-url origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git

7. Check for Merge Conflicts
If your push is rejected, pull the latest changes first:

>git pull origin <branch-name> --rebase

Resolve any conflicts and then push again.
